# Button

This is the **Button** component. The intent of the **Button** is that it will be used for anything that takes a _click_ event with a callback. There is a similar, _Link_ component, but that interacts with navigation, where the **Button** has an event.

<Button onClick={console.log}>Click here</Button>

_This is a button outside of the Storybook Canvas_
